%univariatems performs preliminary univariate robust model selection in linear regression

%<a href="matlab: docsearchFS('univariatems')">Link to the help function</a>
%
% In the situations in which the number of potential explanatory variables
% is very large it is necessary to preliminary understand the subset of
% variables which surely must be excluded before running the proper
% variable selection procedure. This procedure estimates a univariate
% regression model (with intercept) between each column of X and the
% response. Just the variables that have an R2 greater than (or a
% $p$-value smaller than) a certain threshold in the univariate regressions
% are retained. The p-value or R2 threshold are based on robust univariate
% models (with intercept), but the unrobust models can be chosen using
% option thresh. Option fsr enables the user to select the preferred robust
% regression procedure.
%
%
% Required input arguments:
%
%       y:      Response variable. Vector or table with just one column. A
%               vector with n elements that contains the response variables.
%               Missing values (NaN's) and infinite values (Inf's) are
%               allowed, since observations (rows) with missing or infinite
%               values will automatically be excluded from the
%               computations.
%                 Data Types - vector or table
%
%       X :     Predictor variables. Matrix or table. Data matrix of
%               explanatory variables (also called 'regressors') of
%               dimension (n-by-p). Note that, in this case, p can be greater
%               than n. Rows of X represent observations, and columns
%               represent variables. Missing values (NaN's) and infinite
%               values (Inf's) are allowed, since observations (rows) with
%               missing or infinite values will automatically be excluded
%               from the computations. If X is table for the variables,
%               which are defined as categorical function dummyvar is
%               called, and the p-value (R2) refers to the univariate model
%               with all the levels (minus 1) of the categorical variable.
%                 Data Types - matrix or table
%
% Optional input arguments:
%
%        fsr  : Method to use for robust regression. Boolean.
%               If fsr is true univariate robust is based on function FSR
%               (forward search) else it is based on function LXS (LTS or
%               LMS). The default value of fsr is true.
%                 Example - 'fsr',false
%                 Data Types - logical
%
%
%         h   : The number of observations that have determined the robust
%               regression estimator for each univariate regression. Scalar.
%               h is an integer greater or equal than [(n+p+1)/2], but
%               smaller than n.
%                 Example - 'h',round(n*0,75)
%                 Data Types - double
%
%
%         lms : Criterion to use to find the robust  beta
%                 in the univariate regressions. Scalar.
%                   If lms=1 (default) Least Median of Squares is
%               computed, else Least Trimmed of Squares is computed.
%                 Example - 'lms',1
%                 Data Types - double
%
%     nsamp   : Number of subsamples that will be extracted to find the
%                 robust estimator. Scalar.
%               If nsamp=0, all subsets will be extracted.
%               They will be (n choose p).
%               Remark. If the number of all possible subset is <1000, the
%               default is to extract all subsets otherwise just 1000.
%                 Example - 'nsamp',1000
%                 Data Types - double
%
%  PredictorNames : names of the explanatory variables. Cell array of
%               characters or string array.
%               Cell array of characters or string array of length p containing the
%               names of the explanatory variables.
%               If PredictorNames is missing and X is not a table,
%               the following sequence of strings will be
%               automatically created for labelling the column of matrix X
%               ("X1", "X2", "X3", ..., "Xp").
%               Example - 'PredictorNames',{'X1','X2'}
%               Data Types - cell array of characters or string array
%
%
%   thresh:  threshold that defines the variables to retain. Scalar or struct.
%               The default value of thresh is 0.10, that is all variables
%               which in univariate robust regression had a p-value smaller
%               than 0.10 are retained.
%               If thresh is a struct it is possible to specify whether the
%               threshold is based on (robust) p-values or (robust) R2.
%               If thresh is a struct it may contain one of the the
%               following fields:
%               thresh.pval = all variables that, in univariate regression,
%                   have a p-value smaller or equal to thresh.pval are
%                   selected.
%               thresh.pvalrob = all variables that, in univariate
%               regression,
%                   have a robust p-value smaller or equal to thresh.pvalr are
%                   selected.
%               thresh.R2 = all variables that, in univariate regression,
%                   have a R2 square greater or equal to thresh.R2 are
%                   selected.
%               thresh.R2rob = all variables that, in univariate
%               regression,
%                   have a robust R2 square greater or equal to thresh.R2r are
%                   selected.
%                   Note that, if thresh is a struct with both
%                   fields an error is produced because just one between
%                   thresh.pval, thresh.pvalrob, thresh.R2, thresh.R2rob
%                   must be present.
%               Example - 'thresh',0.10
%               Data Types - double
%
%  theoreticalSigns: theoretical sign that the beta from univariate
%               regression must have. Vector of length p.
%               1 denotes a positive sign for the corresponding variable,
%               while -1 denotes a negative sign for the corresponding
%               variable. 0 denotes that any sign is possible. For example,
%               if p is equal to 5, if theoreticalSigns=[1 1 0 -1 1] means
%               that variables 1, 2, and 5 must have a positive robust
%               estimate of the slope in the univariate regression, while
%               variable 4 must have a negative estimate for the robust
%               beta coefficient. Finally, variable 3 can have any sign.
%               Example - 'theoreticalSigns',[-1 1 1 0 -1]. 
%               If theoreticalSigns is empty or it is not specified, no filter
%               based on sign is applied.
